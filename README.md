========

Java Library for fuzzy string matching using TextBrew algorithm.<br>
Library is usable for general use of fuzzy string matching, and can even work for abbreviations and shorthands such as:<br>
`clmbs blvd` and  `columbus boulevard` gives 89% match

## Issues/TODO ##
* Validate the traceback path
* Sometimes the traceback path is different from the test data
